/*
The Constants class provides a convenient place for teams to hold robot-wide numerical or boolean
constants. This class should not be used for any other purpose.  All constants should be
declared globally (i.e. public static). Do not put anything functional in this class.

It is advised to statically import this class (or one of its inner classes) wherever the
constants are needed, to reduce verbosity.
